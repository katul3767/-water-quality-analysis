# Water-quality-analysis
 water quality data collected from multiple sites
This project aims to analyze water quality data collected from multiple sites over time. It involves:

Cleaning and exploring the dataset, addressing missing values by imputing with mean.
Conducting time series analysis on 'Dissolved Oxygen' parameter to understand trends and seasonal patterns.
Performing spatial analysis to compare water quality parameters across different sites.
Utilizing statistical analysis to understand relationships between parameters.
Visualizing the data through various plots to provide insights into water quality variations.
